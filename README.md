# School-feedback-program-with-C
This is a basic program that gathers users feedback based on the status of the user, it is written with C language.
The basic idea of this program is to interact with the user based on their status; whether they are students, teachers, parents or administrators, 
restricting outsiders from giving their feedback through identifying them based on the status. it also limits the inputs to certain types and returns 
a warning message when the condition is not met. Finally, it interacts with the user through messages based on limited choices.

For further editing insights, feel free to use the code to your favor.
Enjoy!!
